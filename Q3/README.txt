Q3 - Ransomware
---------------
Requirements:
    - Kali VM (victim machine)
		- Python 3.x installed
		- OpenSSL installed 
		- File named "my_secrets.txt" in the same directory as the script

The python script will encrypt the file "my_secrets.txt" using a randomly generated symmetric key.
The symmetric key is then encypted with an RSA public key.
After encryption, the script deletes the original "my_secrets.txt" file and the original symmetric key.

The following files are generated by the script:
	- data_cipher.txt (encrypted contents of my_secrets.txt)
	- key_cipher.txt (encrypted symmetric key)
	- private.pem (The attacker's private key)
	- public.pem (The attacker's public key)

Usage:
	python3 ransomware.py
